## Features

### Security

#### JWT Authentication
- Every login issues a signed **JSON Web Token** (JWT) with 12-hour expiry
- Token payload: `userId`, `role`, `name`
- `JWT_SECRET` stored exclusively as a Cloud Run environment variable
- `verifyToken` middleware protects sensitive endpoints (`/admin/chat`, `/super-admin/reset-password`)
- Axios request interceptor in `apiClient.js` automatically attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to every API call — no per-component changes needed

#### Password Hashing (bcrypt)
- All passwords stored as **bcrypt hashes** (salt factor 12) — never plaintext
- **Lazy migration**: on first login after upgrade, plaintext passwords are detected, validated, hashed, and replaced in Firestore transparently — no forced reset, no downtime
- All new users and password resets store hashed values going forward
- Superadmin credentials stored in Firestore (never hardcoded) and protected by the same bcrypt check

#### Chatbot Prompt Injection Defense
- **Input sanitizer** strips known injection phrases (`ignore previous instructions`, `forget everything`, `act as`, `jailbreak`, `DAN mode`, etc.) and caps input at 2,000 characters
- **System prompt security rules** — absolute rules embedded in the LLM prompt that cannot be overridden by any user message: never reveal passwords, credentials, or raw context data; never follow jailbreak-style instructions

---

### Role-Based Access Control
- Three roles: **Super Admin**, **Admin**, and **User**
- Protected routes per role — unauthorized access redirects to login
- Role-aware sidebar navigation and dashboards

### SDS Workflow (4-Stage Pipeline)
Manages Safety Data Sheet processing through four sequential stages:
1. **Search** — Locate and verify SDS documents
2. **Supersede** — Check for newer/superseding versions
3. **Transcription** — Data entry from source SDS documents
4. **Billing** — Generate billing records for completed work

### Batch Workflow
- Bulk SDS processing with batch assignment and upload
- Batch tracking dashboard with per-user progress
- Batch billing and report generation
- **Batch Workflow Control** — admin control panel to manage batch pipeline stages

### DQ (Data Quality) Workflow
- Data quality review pipeline for uploaded references
- DQ assignment, processing forms, and sign-off
- DQ billing integration and reporting

### Reference Database
- Browse, filter, and manage all uploaded references
- Per-company, per-sheet filtering
- Export and search capabilities

### Excel Upload
- Bulk upload references via `.xlsx` / `.xls` files
- Automatic parsing and Firestore insertion
- Supported across SDS, Batch, and DQ workflows

### Reports & Billing
- Per-user, per-sheet billing reports for all three workflows (SDS, Batch, DQ)
- Super Admin consolidated reports across all users and businesses
- Columns: Assigned, Completed, **Prev. Completed**, **Total Pending**, Billed
- All-time completed tracking vs period-filtered completed (correctly differentiated)
- PDF report generation (downloadable) and on-screen table view
- Date-range filtering for period-based reporting
- **Server-side status filter** on SDS Billing — filtering by Ready/Pending is applied before pagination, so page count and totals correctly reflect only the filtered records
- **Back button** on all billing pages uses browser history (`navigate(-1)`) instead of hardcoded dashboard redirect

### AI-Powered Chatbot
- Floating chatbot widget available across all pages
- Powered by **Groq API (LLaMA 3.3 70B)**
- **PDF Upload & Q&A** — upload any PDF and ask questions about its contents
- **PDF Translation** — translate PDF sections line-by-line with side-by-side view:
  - Original text on the left, translated text on the right
  - Sentence-level splitting with numbered-list LLM prompting guarantees perfect 1:1 alignment
  - Supports all major languages including Japanese and other CJK scripts
- **Japanese / CJK PDF support** — uses `NodeCMapReaderFactory` to read character map files directly from the filesystem, enabling correct text extraction from Japanese SDS documents that previously failed silently

### SDS Scanner (AI Microservice)
- Standalone Python + Flask microservice (`sds-scanner/`)
- Upload any SDS PDF and automatically extract:
  - Product name, manufacturer, CAS numbers
  - GHS hazard pictograms (detected via image recognition)
  - Physical/chemical properties, hazard statements, first aid measures
  - Storage, disposal, and emergency contact information
- Powered by Groq (LLaMA 3.3 70B) for field extraction
- Handles both text-based and scanned (image) PDFs
- Results displayed in the **SDS Scanner** admin page with copy-to-clipboard

### Calls & Meetings (Google Meet Integration)
- **Group Calls** — call all currently online users with one click
- **Direct Calls** — 1-on-1 direct call between any two users
- **Schedule Meetings** — schedule future meetings with title, time, duration, description
- **Google Meet links** automatically generated via Google Calendar API v3 (OAuth2)
- Real-time **call notification overlays** across all layouts (User, Admin, SuperAdmin) — poll every 5 seconds
- **CallRoom page** — Google Meet transition screen that opens Meet in a new tab, tracks join/leave status
- **My Meetings tab** — view all scheduled meetings with join link and copy-to-clipboard
- Role-aware navigation and call history per user

### Attendance Tracking
- Super Admin attendance management
- View and manage attendance records per user

### User Management
- Admins can create users and assign roles
- Super Admin user list with edit capabilities
- Status tracking (online/offline/busy)

### Notifications
- Admin and Super Admin notification pages
- System-level alerts and call notifications

### Google Drive Integration
- Linked Google Drive access for SDS document retrieval
- Drive API v3 with service account credentials

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- Python 3.9+
- Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
- Google Cloud SDK: `gcloud` CLI

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samrudhrao13/SARN.git
cd SARN
```

### 2. Install All Dependencies

```bash
# Root runner
npm install

# Backend
cd backend && npm install && cd ..

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# SDS Scanner (Python)
cd sds-scanner
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

**Backend** — create `backend/.env`:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

**SDS Scanner** — create `sds-scanner/.env`:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

**Cloud Run (production)** — set via gcloud:
```bash
gcloud run services update sarn-backend --region=asia-south1 \
  --update-env-vars="GROQ_API_KEY=...,GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...,GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...,GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=..."
```

**Service account credentials** (never commit these):
- `backend/sarn-technologies-21d6e-a45c0f181abc.json` — Firebase Admin SDK
- `backend/sarn-drive-access.json` — Google Drive API

### 4. Run Locally (All Services)

```bash
npm start
```

This starts all three services concurrently:
- Backend at `http://localhost:4002`
- Frontend at `http://localhost:5173`
- SDS Scanner at `http://localhost:5050`

Or run individually:
```bash
npm run backend    # Express server
npm run frontend   # Vite dev server
npm run scanner    # Python Flask scanner
```

## Google Meet Integration

Calls and meetings use the **Google Calendar API v3** with OAuth2 to generate real `meet.google.com` links:

1. A Google OAuth2 client is configured with `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`
2. Every call/meeting creation automatically creates a Google Calendar event with a Google Meet conference
3. The Meet link is stored in Firestore and returned to users
4. Users open Meet in a new tab; the CallRoom page tracks join/leave status

---

## SDS Scanner Microservice

The `sds-scanner/` directory is a standalone Python Flask service:

- **Endpoint:** `POST /scan` — accepts a PDF file, returns extracted SDS fields as JSON
- Supports text-based and scanned PDFs
- GHS pictogram detection via image matching
- Field extraction via Groq LLaMA 3.3 70B
- CORS configured for the Vite dev server
